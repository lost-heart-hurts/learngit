All I want to get is a period of totally engaged and action.
But I was constantly thinking, drowning in the past mistakes and made mistakes for wastinng the current time as the same time.
the thinking circle is endless and just the source of anxiety
So, as long as I started working, all the discomfort will disappear.
stepped out and secure the fulfillment.


A abyss fault:
i mistake tired and exhausted as the **only** flag of value.
That means, reversely, sober is fault.
so when i am sane, I would drive me mad.

When tired, if it is due to hardwork, the value comes from fulfillment, which is gained from hardwork, not exhaustion.
if it is due to bad habits or wrong distribution on energy, you should apology, avoid excessive self blame and adjust your status according to possible deadlines.
Sure, you can comfort yourself that bad status may indicates the break of accumulating tiredness, but it can never be the excuse of games, as sleep or having a cold face-washing is absolutely better.

do not let the hesitation or fear waste your enengy.
be optimistic and decisive.
