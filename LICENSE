All I want to get is a period of totally engaged and action.
But I was constantly thinking, drowning in the past mistakes and made mistakes for wastinng the current time as the same time.
the thinking circle is endless and just the source of anxiety
So, as long as I started working, all the discomfort will disappear.
stepped out and secure the fulfillment.


A abyss fault:
i mistake tired and exhausted as the **only** flag of value.
That means, reversely, sober is fault.
so when i am sane, I would drive me mad.
